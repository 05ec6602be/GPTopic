INTRODUCTION       From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war; Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.       Science flourished during the European Renaissance. Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries.       But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity and travel to the Moon and to other planets.       The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the Sun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.       These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight and other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light. And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.       Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century.        AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT       The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s) automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.       Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well as for processing data and communicating with Earth.       Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power.       Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft.       The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a spacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.       Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid-rock composition.       For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.       All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power source. The first and the',\n",
       "  'Although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it\\'s an old canard in the space business called \"trolling for billionaires\"), there is a good chance that a much smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd Congress. This is the Back to the Moon bill, put together by the people who passed the Launch Services Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding. There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million.   Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the Delta Clipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million). We have a clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed to simply wishing for our dreams to come true. Please support the Back to the Moon bill.

If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings, but we also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would have concentrated on the moon. \",\n",

As published in \"US Industrial Outlook 1993\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year\\'s projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

       "  'Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $  PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS      This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes     (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (',\n",

I got the vague impression from their mission proposal that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without  explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  That's great, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically.     But I'm a _member_.

       "  'From the article \"What\\'s New\" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:  ........ WHAT\\'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC  1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE \"SPINOFFS\" WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published \"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with \"SCHWARZENEGGER\" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold\\'s latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night). Is NASA really supporting this junk? Are protesting groups being organized in the States? Really, really depressed.               Enzo',\n",
       "  'I have often thought about, if its possible to have a powerfull laser on earth, to light at the Moon, and show lasergraphics at the surface so clearly that you can see it with your eyes when there is a new moon.  How about a Coca Cola logo at the moon, easy way to target billions of people.  Do you know if its possible?  ',\n",
       "  'At one time there was speculation that the first spacewalk  (Alexei Leonov ?) was a staged fake.  Has any evidence to support or contradict this claim emerged ?  Was this claim perhaps another fevered Cold War hallucination ? ',\n",
       "  'From the \"JPL Universe\" April 23, 1993  VLBI project meets with international space agencies',\n",
       "  ' Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By  the time they could make the Earth\\'s sky look like Las Vegas,  the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as 5000 kg in a Low Earth \"advertising\" orbit: Very roughly the same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...  The night sky on a Lunar backpacking trip would still be very  pristine...   There\\'s always been a problem of having to get  away from civilization before you can really find \"natural\" scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn\\'t take a trip of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still \"wild.\" While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital billboards aren\\'t the problem: They are just a symptom of  growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will not save your view of the night sky, because by the time  such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_ the stars...    An ad on a moon of Jupiter would be rather pointless, since you need a telescope to see them. However, I\\'d love to see them get all the publicity they could from underwritting the \"Coca Cola Io Orbital Mapping Probe.\"     They already can, to some extent: The IAU allows names derived from sponsors or patrons of scientific research. If Microscum donates money to a university astronomy program, one of the galactic  astronomers could easily get a newly discovered galaxy named after them.',\n",
